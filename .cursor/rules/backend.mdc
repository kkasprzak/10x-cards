### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
- Use SupabaseClient type from `src/db/supabase.client.ts`, not from `@supabase/supabase-js`

### API Types and Validation

- Keep API types in `src/types.ts`
- Backend validation schemas stay in service files (`src/lib/services/*.ts`)
- Focus on data integrity and security in backend validation
- Use TypeScript interfaces for API contracts
